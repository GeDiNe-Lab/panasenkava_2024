# General notes
"Condition1 VS Condition2" in DE means "Expression in **Condition1** compare to **Condition2**"
A gene with a FoldChange > 0 is **MORE** expressed in **Condition1** compare to **Condition2**
A gene with a FoldChange < 0 is **LESS** expressed in **Condition1** compare to **Condition2**

## PCA
### F2A_1_PCA
PCA colored by dorso/ventral patterning (type) or lineage (line), with all or the top 500 variable genes, for PC1/2 or PC2/3

## Kinetic Heatmap
### F2A_DE_HM
Heatmap of the top 1000 genes correlated with PC1 and PC2 (absolute Pearson correlation) that or not in the top 1000 genes correlated with PC3.
PC1 is associated with kinetic, PC2 is associated with dorso/ventral patterning, PC3 is associated with lineage difference

There is 2 level of clustering subclustering has been made using gene from each cluster of the first level respectively

## PCA_type
PCA on the WTC CRISPR lineage for vAN,dAN, vAN+dAN

## volcano plots
Volcano plots for the DEGs with 3 group of samples : vAN, dAN and vAN+dAN
contrast are :
 * control_vs_homo
 * control_vs_het
 * het_vs_homo

## Markers barplots
Barplots of the scaled normalized expression for 4 marker genes for vAN and dAN samples
(values are the normalized readcounts rescaled so the minimum normalized value (accounting for 0 read) is equal to 0)

## Coexpressed genes barplots
Barplots of the scaled normalized expression for genes found through co-expression analysis with both dAN and vAN samples
