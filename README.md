## Coexpressed genes
### Cytoscape_SHH
genes retained in the coexpression analysis with either 0.8 or 0.85 absolute pearson correlation with one the genes used (SHH, NKX2.1, PAX6), tehre is an image for the genes positively co-expressed with SHH and one for the genes negatively co-expressed with SHH, color are : gold -> already known genes, red -> gene selected through literature curation and potentially tested in mice.
