# General notes
"Condition1 VS Condition2" in DE means "Expression in **Condition1** compare to **Condition2**"
A gene with a FoldChange > 0 is **MORE** expressed in **Condition1** compare to **Condition2**
A gene with a FoldChange < 0 is **LESS** expressed in **Condition1** compare to **Condition2**

## PCA
### F2A_1_PCA
PCA colored by dorso/ventral patterning (type) or lineage (line), with all or the top 500 variable genes, for PC1/2 or PC2/3
PC_covariate_correlation indicates the correlation between PC and covariates, the pvalue of the ANOVA associated are in tables/Figure_2A/F2_PC_covariate_ANOVA_500.csv and

## Kinetic Heatmap
### F2A_DE_HM
Heatmap of the top 1000 genes correlated with PC1 and PC2 (absolute Pearson correlation) that or not in the top 1000 genes correlated with PC3.
PC1 is associated with kinetic, PC2 is associated with dorso/ventral patterning, PC3 is associated with lineage difference

There is 2 level of clustering subclustering has been made using gene from each cluster of the first level respectively

DE genes information can be found in tables/Figure_3/cyclo_genes_df.csv
Volcano plots for highly DE genes between the different dose of cyclopamin (abs(log2FC) >= 2, padj < 0.01)

## Coexpressed genes 
genes retained in the coexpression analysis are those with absolute pearson correlation >= 0.85  with one the genes used (SHH, NKX2.1, PAX6)

## STRING network
Networks built by passing coexpressed genes to STRING, as STRING give information about protein relationship I also mannually added to the network non-coding genes that were highly correlated to SHH, NKX2.1 or PAX6 (absolute Pearson correlation >= 0.95)

## Markers barplots
Barplots of the scaled normalized expression for 4 marker genes for vAN and dAN samples
(values are the normalized readcounts rescaled so the minimum normalized value (accounting for 0 read) is equal to 0)
